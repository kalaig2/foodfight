Quick edit "There are no shipping methods available ..." WooCommerce message

== Description ==

With the plugin you can easily replace the standard WooCommerce message "There are no shipping methods available.
Please double check your address, or contact us if you need any help." with your own text. It works on both cart and
checkout pages.

By default, the customer sees "There are no shipping methods available ..." message when there are no delivery options
configured for their order because they choose a destination you don't ship to, or have too many items in the cart, or
meet another edge condition you haven't thought through. Providing a custom message is useful to explain to your
customer in more detail why shipping is not available and what to do next. You can also provide an actual link to
your contact page.

Message examples:

- "You order exceeds 10 kg. Please [contact us](#) to get a quote."
- "Shipping to the selected country for orders under $100 is not available. Please add choose more items to purchase or [contact us](#)."
- "[Product] is not available for shipping to the selected destination."
- "Unfortunately, we can't deliver your order. Please [contact us](#) for details."
